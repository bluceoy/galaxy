**What Does This Module Do**
Sargfam database and profile Hidden Markov Models based alignment algorithm for ARGs-like sequences annotation were a function module in ARGs-OAP v2.0, supporting supplementary sequence retrieval strategy to current similarity search method (i.e. UBLAST and BLAST), especially applied on detecting remote homolog (novel genes). 


**How to Use This Module**

To conduct HMMSACN against Sargfam, users should locally assemble raw reads into contigs first and predict ORFs within the contigs, and then those predicted ORFs (in fasta format) can be uploaded to the online Galaxy for identification of ARGs-like protein. The results summarized in table listed the exact ARGs types and subtypes the input sequences were annotated can be downloaded from the online server. Currently we only accept proteins sequences as input query but we are working on this and in the near future new services will be supplemented for nucleotide sequences.
HMMER 3 suite (http://hmmer.org/) is the fundamental tool to do the above mentioned alignment. Indeed, we use HMMSCAN input sequences against Sargfam with parameter ¨-cut_ga, which stands for inclusive optimized cut off gathering threshold (GA) 

**How was Sargfam Constructed**
From 12307 ARGs sequences within the comprehensive SARG v2.0 database, 9080 sequences belonged to 189 ARGs subtypes, each of which contains more than 3 sequences, were selected as candidates for profile HMMs of ARGs¡¯ construction. For each subtype, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed and those questionable sequence(s) which was distantly related to the core cluster were filtered out. Then, train subset was randomly chosen from each subtype and used for profile HMMs constructed by HMMER 3 suite, while the remaining sequences were used as the test subset for validation. After that, a specific gathering threshold (GA) was selected in the range of 1 to 3000 for each profile HMM to optimize the quality for the constructed model by Shell scripts. Lastly, the validation was conducted for each profile HMM by retrieving target sequences through HMMSCAN from a specific test mixture of target sequences with non-target sequences in other subtypes to calculate the recall and precision value. Those profile HMMs with both precision and recall values over 80% were retained as the validated profiles. Sargfam was the gathering of these profiles and formatted models for ARGs annotation. _
